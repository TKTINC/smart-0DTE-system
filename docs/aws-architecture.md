# Smart-0DTE-System AWS Cloud Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Smart-0DTE-System AWS cloud architecture provides a scalable, secure, and highly available infrastructure for deploying the intelligent options trading platform. This document outlines the comprehensive cloud design that supports real-time market data processing, AI-powered signal generation, automated trading execution, and enterprise-grade monitoring across multiple AWS regions.

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Design Principles

The AWS architecture follows cloud-native design principles to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. The system leverages a microservices architecture deployed across multiple Availability Zones with auto-scaling capabilities, comprehensive monitoring, and disaster recovery mechanisms.

The core architecture consists of several key layers: the presentation layer hosting the React frontend, the application layer running the FastAPI backend services, the data layer managing PostgreSQL, Redis, and InfluxDB databases, and the integration layer handling external market data feeds and broker connections. Each layer is designed for independent scaling and fault tolerance.

### Regional Deployment Strategy

The primary deployment targets the US East (N. Virginia) region for optimal latency to major financial markets and data providers. A secondary deployment in US West (Oregon) provides disaster recovery capabilities and geographic redundancy. The architecture supports active-passive failover with automated health checks and traffic routing.

## Core Infrastructure Components

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Design

The foundation of the AWS architecture is a custom VPC spanning three Availability Zones for maximum redundancy. The VPC uses a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block with carefully planned subnets to segregate different tiers of the application.

Public subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24) host the Application Load Balancer and NAT Gateways, providing internet access while maintaining security. Private subnets (10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24, 10.0.13.0/24) contain the application servers and caching layer, isolated from direct internet access. Database subnets (10.0.21.0/24, 10.0.22.0/24, 10.0.23.0/24) provide the most secure environment for data storage with no internet connectivity.

### Compute Infrastructure

#### Amazon ECS with Fargate

The application layer utilizes Amazon ECS with Fargate for containerized deployment, eliminating the need for EC2 instance management while providing automatic scaling and high availability. The FastAPI backend runs in ECS tasks with configurable CPU and memory allocations based on workload requirements.

Each ECS service is configured with auto-scaling policies that monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and custom CloudWatch metrics such as active trading signals and market data processing rates. The services can scale from a minimum of 2 tasks to a maximum of 20 tasks per service, ensuring adequate capacity during high-volume trading periods.

#### Application Load Balancer

An Application Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple ECS tasks, providing health checks and automatic failover. The ALB is configured with SSL termination using AWS Certificate Manager, ensuring all communications are encrypted in transit.

The load balancer implements path-based routing to direct API requests to the appropriate backend services, WebSocket connections to real-time data services, and static content requests to CloudFront distributions. Health checks monitor the /health endpoint of each service with configurable thresholds for response time and error rates.

### Data Storage Architecture

#### Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

The primary relational database uses Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and automatic failover. The database instance runs on db.r6g.xlarge instances with 4 vCPUs and 32 GB RAM, providing sufficient performance for transactional workloads.

Database storage utilizes gp3 SSD volumes with 1000 GB initial capacity and auto-scaling enabled up to 10 TB. Automated backups retain data for 30 days with point-in-time recovery capabilities. Read replicas in secondary regions provide disaster recovery and read scaling for reporting workloads.

#### Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

The caching layer employs Amazon ElastiCache for Redis with cluster mode enabled for horizontal scaling and high availability. The Redis cluster consists of 3 shards with 2 replicas each, providing 6 total nodes for optimal performance and redundancy.

Each cache node runs on cache.r6g.large instances with 2 vCPUs and 13 GB RAM. The cluster is configured with automatic failover and backup enabled, storing snapshots in S3 for disaster recovery. Redis AUTH and encryption in transit and at rest ensure data security.

#### Amazon Timestream for Time-Series Data

Market data and performance metrics utilize Amazon Timestream, a purpose-built time-series database that automatically scales and optimizes storage costs. Timestream stores high-frequency market data with configurable retention policies: 24 hours in memory storage for real-time queries and 1 year in magnetic storage for historical analysis.

The database is configured with adaptive query processing and automatic indexing for optimal query performance. Data ingestion utilizes batch writes to minimize costs while maintaining low latency for real-time applications.

### Content Delivery and Static Assets

#### Amazon CloudFront

The React frontend is distributed globally through Amazon CloudFront, providing low-latency access to users worldwide. CloudFront caches static assets at edge locations and implements intelligent routing to the nearest origin.

The distribution is configured with custom cache behaviors for different content types: static assets (CSS, JS, images) cached for 1 year, API responses cached for 1 minute, and real-time data bypassed from caching. SSL certificates from AWS Certificate Manager ensure secure connections.

#### Amazon S3

Static assets, deployment artifacts, and backup files are stored in Amazon S3 with versioning enabled and lifecycle policies for cost optimization. The S3 bucket implements server-side encryption with AWS KMS and access logging for security compliance.

Intelligent tiering automatically moves infrequently accessed objects to lower-cost storage classes, while cross-region replication provides disaster recovery for critical assets. Pre-signed URLs enable secure, time-limited access to sensitive files.

## Security Architecture

### Identity and Access Management

AWS IAM provides fine-grained access control with least-privilege principles. Service-specific IAM roles grant only necessary permissions for each component, while cross-service access uses IAM roles for service-to-service authentication.

The architecture implements separate IAM roles for development, staging, and production environments with different permission levels. Multi-factor authentication is required for all administrative access, and AWS CloudTrail logs all API calls for audit compliance.

### Network Security

Security groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling traffic at the instance level. The application tier security group allows HTTPS traffic from the load balancer, while the database tier security group permits connections only from the application tier on specific ports.

Network ACLs provide subnet-level security as an additional layer of defense. VPC Flow Logs capture network traffic for security analysis and compliance reporting. AWS WAF protects the application from common web exploits and bot attacks.

### Data Encryption

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using AWS-managed encryption services. RDS encryption uses AWS KMS with customer-managed keys for database encryption. ElastiCache implements encryption in transit and at rest with automatic key rotation.

S3 buckets use server-side encryption with KMS keys, and CloudFront distributions enforce HTTPS connections. Application-level encryption protects sensitive trading data and API keys using AWS Secrets Manager.

### Secrets Management

AWS Secrets Manager stores and rotates database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive configuration data. The application retrieves secrets at runtime using IAM roles, eliminating hardcoded credentials in code or configuration files.

Secrets are encrypted with customer-managed KMS keys and automatically rotated on configurable schedules. Cross-region replication ensures secrets availability during disaster recovery scenarios.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Amazon CloudWatch

Comprehensive monitoring utilizes Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms. Custom metrics track business-specific KPIs such as trading signal accuracy, position P&L, and market data latency. CloudWatch Dashboards provide real-time visibility into system performance and trading metrics.

CloudWatch Logs aggregates application logs from all services with configurable retention periods and log insights for advanced querying. Log groups are organized by service and environment with appropriate access controls.

### AWS X-Ray

Distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray provides end-to-end visibility into request flows across microservices. X-Ray traces help identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical trading paths from signal generation to order execution.

Service maps visualize the application architecture and dependencies, while trace analysis identifies slow database queries, external API calls, and service communication patterns.

### Application Performance Monitoring

Custom CloudWatch metrics monitor trading-specific performance indicators including signal generation latency, order execution time, and market data processing rates. Alarms trigger automated responses for critical thresholds such as high error rates or trading system failures.

The monitoring system implements escalating alert policies with immediate notifications for critical issues and summary reports for operational metrics. Integration with AWS SNS enables multi-channel alerting via email, SMS, and Slack.

## Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline

### AWS CodePipeline

Automated deployment utilizes AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline triggers on code commits to the main branch, executing automated tests, building container images, and deploying to staging and production environments.

The pipeline consists of multiple stages: source code retrieval from GitHub, automated testing with AWS CodeBuild, container image building and pushing to Amazon ECR, and deployment to ECS services with blue-green deployment strategies.

### AWS CodeBuild

Build processes run in AWS CodeBuild with custom build environments for Python and Node.js applications. Build specifications define the complete build process including dependency installation, test execution, security scanning, and artifact generation.

CodeBuild projects are configured with appropriate IAM roles for accessing AWS services and external dependencies. Build artifacts are stored in S3 with versioning for rollback capabilities.

### Amazon ECR

Container images are stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry with vulnerability scanning enabled. ECR repositories implement lifecycle policies to automatically remove old images and reduce storage costs while maintaining recent versions for rollback.

Image scanning identifies security vulnerabilities in container images before deployment, integrating with the CI/CD pipeline to prevent vulnerable images from reaching production environments.

### Blue-Green Deployment

ECS services implement blue-green deployment strategies for zero-downtime updates. The deployment process creates new task definitions with updated container images, gradually shifts traffic from old to new versions, and monitors health metrics during the transition.

Automated rollback mechanisms detect deployment failures and automatically revert to the previous stable version. CloudWatch alarms monitor key metrics during deployments and trigger rollbacks if error rates exceed acceptable thresholds.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

### Multi-Region Architecture

The disaster recovery strategy implements active-passive replication across AWS regions. The primary region (us-east-1) handles all production traffic, while the secondary region (us-west-2) maintains synchronized data replicas and standby infrastructure.

RDS cross-region read replicas provide database redundancy with configurable replication lag monitoring. S3 cross-region replication ensures backup data availability in multiple regions. Route 53 health checks automatically failover DNS routing during primary region outages.

### Backup and Recovery Procedures

Automated backup procedures protect all critical data with configurable retention periods. RDS automated backups provide point-in-time recovery for 30 days, while manual snapshots enable long-term retention for compliance requirements.

ElastiCache backups store Redis snapshots in S3 with cross-region replication. Application data and configuration backups utilize AWS Backup for centralized backup management across multiple services.

### Recovery Time and Point Objectives

The architecture targets a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 15 minutes and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 5 minutes for critical trading systems. Automated failover procedures minimize manual intervention during disaster scenarios.

Regular disaster recovery testing validates failover procedures and recovery time objectives. Runbooks document step-by-step recovery procedures for different failure scenarios including region outages, database failures, and application service disruptions.

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Right-Sizing

The architecture implements cost optimization through appropriate resource sizing based on actual usage patterns. ECS auto-scaling policies ensure resources scale with demand, while Spot instances reduce costs for non-critical workloads.

Reserved instances provide cost savings for predictable workloads such as database instances and baseline compute capacity. Savings plans offer additional discounts for consistent usage patterns across multiple services.

### Storage Cost Management

S3 Intelligent Tiering automatically optimizes storage costs by moving objects between access tiers based on usage patterns. Lifecycle policies delete temporary files and archive old data to Glacier for long-term retention at reduced costs.

Database storage optimization includes automated storage scaling and performance insights to identify unused indexes and optimize query performance. CloudWatch metrics monitor storage utilization and growth trends for capacity planning.

### Monitoring and Alerting for Cost Control
