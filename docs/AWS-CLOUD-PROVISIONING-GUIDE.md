## AWS Account Setup and Initial Configuration

### Creating Your AWS Account

Setting up an AWS account is the first step in deploying the Smart-0DTE-System to the cloud. For a PoC environment, we'll focus on essential configurations that provide security and cost control while maintaining simplicity.

**Account Registration Process**

1. Visit [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and click "Create an AWS Account"
2. Use a dedicated email address: `aws-admin@your-domain.com`
3. Account name: "Smart-0DTE-Trading-System-PoC"
4. Provide valid phone number and credit card for verification

**Initial Security Configuration**

Immediately after account creation, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your root account:

```bash
# After installing AWS CLI
aws iam enable-mfa-device \
  --user-name root \
  --serial-number arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:mfa/root-account-mfa-device \
  --authentication-code1 123456 \
  --authentication-code2 789012
```

**Billing Alerts Setup**

Set up billing alerts to monitor costs during your PoC:

```bash
# Create billing alarm for PoC cost control
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "Smart-0DTE-PoC-Billing-Alert" \
  --alarm-description "Alert when monthly bill exceeds $300" \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 86400 \
  --threshold 300 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --dimensions Name=Currency,Value=USD \
  --evaluation-periods 1
```

### Prerequisites Installation

Install the necessary tools on your local machine:

```bash
# Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Install Terraform
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
```

When prompted, enter:
- AWS Access Key ID: [Your access key]
- AWS Secret Access Key: [Your secret key]
- Default region name: us-east-1
- Default output format: json

---

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Configuration

### Create IAM User for PoC

Create a dedicated IAM user for your PoC deployment:

```bash
# Create PoC user
aws iam create-user --user-name smart-0dte-poc-user

# Create and attach policy
cat > poc-policy.json << EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "rds:*",
        "elasticache:*",
        "iam:*",
        "cloudwatch:*",
        "logs:*",
        "s3:*",
        "route53:*",
        "acm:*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy --policy-name Smart0DTEPoCPolicy --policy-document file://poc-policy.json
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name smart-0dte-poc-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:policy/Smart0DTEPoCPolicy

# Create access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name smart-0dte-poc-user
```

### Create SSH Key Pair

Create an SSH key pair for EC2 access:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/smart-0dte-poc-key

# Upload public key to AWS
aws ec2 import-key-pair \
  --key-name smart-0dte-poc-key \
  --public-key-material fileb://~/.ssh/smart-0dte-poc-key.pub
```

```hcl
# terraform/main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "poc" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-vpc"
    Environment = "poc"
    Project     = "smart-0dte-system"
  }
}

# Public subnet for load balancer
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.poc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone       = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0]
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-public-subnet"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}

# Private subnet for application
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.poc.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[0]

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-private-subnet"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}

# Internet Gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "poc" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.poc.id

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-igw"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}

# NAT Gateway for private subnet
resource "aws_eip" "nat" {
  domain = "vpc"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-nat-eip"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "poc" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public.id

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-nat-gateway"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}
```

## Single Environment Deployment

### Quick Deployment

After completing the AWS account setup, deploy your single PoC environment:

```bash
# Clone repositories
git clone https://github.com/TKTINC/smart-0DTE-system.git
git clone https://github.com/TKTINC/mag7-7DTE-system.git

# Deploy single environment with both systems
./deploy-single-environment.sh poc both
```

### Expected Deployment Time

- **Initial deployment**: 15-20 minutes
- **Application startup**: 5-10 minutes
- **Total time to trading**: 25-30 minutes

### Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Check deployment status
terraform show

# Get application URLs
terraform output load_balancer_url

# SSH into instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/smart-0dte-poc-key.pem ec2-user@$(terraform output -raw instance_public_ip)

# Check applications
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Smart-0DTE
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Mag7-7DTE
```

## Cost Optimization and Management

### Monthly Cost Breakdown

```
Single PoC Environment: ~$200/month
├── EC2 t3.xlarge: $150/month
├── RDS db.t3.small: $25/month
├── ElastiCache t3.micro: $15/month
└── Storage & Networking: $10/month

vs Multi-Environment: ~$580/month
Savings: $380/month (66% reduction)
```

### Cost Monitoring

```bash
# Set up cost alerts
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) \
  --budget '{
    "BudgetName": "Smart-0DTE-PoC-Budget",
    "BudgetLimit": {
      "Amount": "250",
      "Unit": "USD"
    },
    "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
    "BudgetType": "COST"
  }'
```

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Stop instances during non-trading hours** (if not running 24/7)
2. **Use spot instances** for development work (50-70% savings)
3. **Monitor data transfer costs** with CloudWatch
4. **Set up billing alerts** at $100, $200, and $300 thresholds

## Security Configuration

### Security Groups

```hcl
# Application security group
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name_prefix = "smart-0dte-poc-app-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.poc.id

  # SSH access (restrict to your IP)
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.admin_cidr]  # Replace with your IP
  }

  # Application ports
  ingress {
    from_port       = 8000
    to_port         = 8001
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  }

  # Frontend ports
  ingress {
    from_port       = 3000
    to_port         = 3001
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "smart-0dte-poc-app-sg"
    Environment = "poc"
  }
}
```

---

## Monitoring and Logging Setup

### CloudWatch Configuration

```hcl
# CloudWatch dashboard
resource "aws_cloudwatch_dashboard" "poc" {
  dashboard_name = "Smart-0DTE-PoC-Dashboard"

  dashboard_body = jsonencode({
    widgets = [
      {
        type   = "metric"
        x      = 0
        y      = 0
        width  = 12
        height = 6

        properties = {
          metrics = [
            ["AWS/EC2", "CPUUtilization", "InstanceId", aws_instance.app.id],
            [".", "NetworkIn", ".", "."],
            [".", "NetworkOut", ".", "."]
          ]
          period = 300
          stat   = "Average"
          region = var.aws_region
          title  = "EC2 Instance Metrics"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## AWS Account Setup and Initial Configuration

### Creating Your AWS Account

Setting up an AWS account is the first step in deploying the Smart-0DTE-System to the cloud. The account creation process requires careful attention to billing configuration, security settings, and initial service access to ensure proper foundation for your trading system infrastructure.

**Account Registration Process**

Begin by visiting the AWS website and selecting the "Create an AWS Account" option. You will need to provide a valid email address that will serve as your root account identifier, a strong password, and an AWS account name. Choose an account name that clearly identifies the purpose, such as "Smart-0DTE-Trading-System" or your organization name followed by "Trading."

The registration process requires a valid phone number for account verification and a credit card for billing purposes. AWS will charge a small amount (typically $1) to verify the credit card, which will be refunded. Ensure you use a credit card with sufficient available credit, as AWS charges can accumulate quickly if resources are not properly managed.

During registration, you will be asked to select a support plan. For production trading systems, the "Business" support plan ($100/month minimum) is recommended as it provides 24/7 technical support, which is crucial for trading operations that may require immediate assistance during market hours. However, you can start with the "Basic" free plan and upgrade later as needed.

**Initial Security Configuration**

Immediately after account creation, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your root account. This is critical for protecting your AWS account from unauthorized access, especially important for financial trading systems. Use a hardware MFA device or a mobile app like Google Authenticator or AWS Virtual MFA for enhanced security.

Configure account contact information including billing, operations, and security contacts. Ensure these contacts are monitored regularly and can respond quickly to AWS notifications, billing alerts, or security incidents. For trading operations, consider setting up a dedicated email address for AWS notifications.

Set up billing alerts to monitor AWS costs and prevent unexpected charges. Configure billing alerts at multiple thresholds (e.g., $50, $100, $500, $1000) to provide early warning of increasing costs. This is particularly important during initial setup when it's easy to accidentally leave expensive resources running.

**Regional Selection and Availability Zones**

Choose an appropriate AWS region for your Smart-0DTE-System deployment based on your geographic location, regulatory requirements, and latency considerations. For trading systems, latency to market data sources and broker APIs is crucial for optimal performance.

US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) is often the best choice for US-based trading operations as it typically provides the lowest latency to major financial data providers and has the most comprehensive service availability. US-West-2 (Oregon) is an alternative that may offer better pricing for some services while maintaining good performance.

Consider regulatory requirements if you operate in specific jurisdictions. Some financial regulations require data to remain within certain geographic boundaries, which may influence your region selection. Ensure your chosen region complies with all applicable regulatory requirements.

### Billing and Cost Management Setup

**Billing Dashboard Configuration**

Configure the AWS Billing Dashboard to provide comprehensive visibility into your costs and usage patterns. Enable detailed billing reports, cost allocation tags, and budget tracking to maintain control over your AWS spending throughout the Smart-0DTE-System deployment and operation.

Set up Cost Explorer to analyze spending patterns and identify cost optimization opportunities. Configure custom cost reports that track spending by service, region, and resource tags to understand where your money is being spent and identify areas for optimization.

Enable AWS Cost and Usage Reports for detailed billing analysis and integration with external financial systems. These reports provide granular usage data that can be used for cost allocation, budgeting, and financial planning for your trading system operations.

**Budget and Alert Configuration**

Create multiple budgets to track different aspects of your AWS spending including overall account spending, service-specific spending, and project-specific spending. Configure budgets with appropriate thresholds and alert mechanisms to provide early warning of cost overruns.

Set up budget alerts that notify appropriate stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds defined thresholds. Configure alerts to be sent to multiple recipients and through multiple channels (email, SMS) to ensure timely notification of cost issues.

Configure automated actions for budget alerts including service shutdown, resource scaling, or approval workflows for additional spending. These automated responses can help prevent runaway costs while maintaining system availability for critical trading operations.

**Cost Allocation and Tagging Strategy**

Implement a comprehensive tagging strategy that enables accurate cost allocation and resource management throughout your Smart-0DTE-System deployment. Use consistent tags for environment (production, staging, development), component (database, application, monitoring), and cost center allocation.

Configure cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing Dashboard to enable cost tracking by different dimensions. This capability is essential for understanding the cost of different system components and optimizing spending across the entire Smart-0DTE-System infrastructure.

Establish tagging policies and governance procedures to ensure consistent tag application across all AWS resources. Implement automated tagging where possible and regular auditing to maintain tag compliance and accuracy for cost management purposes.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Configuration

### IAM User and Role Setup

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is fundamental to securing your Smart-0DTE-System deployment on AWS. Proper IAM configuration ensures that users, applications, and services have appropriate access to AWS resources while maintaining security and compliance with financial industry standards.

**Administrative User Creation**

Create dedicated administrative users for managing the Smart-0DTE-System infrastructure rather than using the root account for day-to-day operations. The root account should be reserved for account-level operations and emergency access only. Create an administrative user with a descriptive name such as "smart-0dte-admin" or use your organization's naming convention.

Configure the administrative user with appropriate permissions for managing all AWS services required for the Smart-0DTE-System. Initially, you may grant broad administrative permissions, but these should be refined over time to follow the principle of least privilege as your understanding of specific requirements develops.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative users to provide additional security for privileged accounts. Use hardware MFA devices or mobile authenticator apps to ensure that administrative access requires both password and MFA token verification.

**Service Roles and Policies**

Create dedicated service roles for different components of the Smart-0DTE-System including application servers, database services, and monitoring systems. Each service role should have permissions tailored to the specific requirements of that service, following the principle of least privilege.

The application server role requires permissions for accessing databases, reading configuration from Systems Manager Parameter Store, writing logs to CloudWatch, and accessing other AWS services used by the Smart-0DTE-System. Create custom policies that grant only the specific permissions required for application operation.

Database service roles require permissions for backup operations, monitoring, and maintenance tasks. Configure these roles with appropriate permissions for automated backup, performance monitoring, and maintenance operations while restricting access to sensitive database operations.

**Cross-Service Access Configuration**

Configure cross-service access policies that enable different AWS services to interact securely on behalf of your Smart-0DTE-System. This includes allowing EC2 instances to access RDS databases, Lambda functions to access S3 buckets, and CloudWatch to access various services for monitoring.

Implement resource-based policies where appropriate to control access to specific resources such as S3 buckets, KMS keys, and database instances. Resource-based policies provide fine-grained control over resource access and can complement IAM user and role policies.

Configure trust relationships between roles to enable secure role assumption for different operational scenarios. This capability is particularly useful for deployment automation, cross-account access, and service integration within the Smart-0DTE-System architecture.

### Security Policies and Compliance

**Password and Access Policies**

Implement strong password policies for all IAM users including minimum length requirements, complexity requirements, and password rotation policies. For trading systems, consider requiring passwords of at least 14 characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters.

Configure account lockout policies that protect against brute force attacks while maintaining accessibility for legitimate users. Implement progressive lockout periods and account recovery procedures that balance security with operational requirements.

Set up access key rotation policies for programmatic access to AWS services. Regular rotation of access keys reduces the risk of compromised credentials and is a security best practice for financial systems handling sensitive trading data.

**Audit and Compliance Configuration**

Enable AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging of all API calls and user activities within your AWS account. Configure CloudTrail to log all management events and data events relevant to your Smart-0DTE-System for complete audit trail coverage.

Configure CloudTrail log file validation to ensure the integrity of audit logs and detect any tampering or unauthorized modifications. This capability is essential for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis in case of security incidents.

Set up automated compliance monitoring using AWS Config to track configuration changes and compliance with security policies. Configure Config rules that monitor IAM policies, security group configurations, and other security-relevant settings for continuous compliance monitoring.

**Access Review and Governance**

Implement regular access reviews to ensure that user permissions remain appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege. Schedule quarterly reviews of all IAM users, roles, and policies to identify and remove unnecessary permissions or unused accounts.

Configure automated reporting of IAM usage and permissions to identify inactive users, unused roles, and overly permissive policies. Use AWS Access Analyzer to identify resources that are shared with external entities and ensure that sharing is intentional and appropriate.

Establish governance procedures for requesting, approving, and implementing changes to IAM policies and permissions. Implement approval workflows for privileged access and document all permission changes for audit and compliance purposes.

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network Setup

### VPC Architecture Design

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides the network foundation for your Smart-0DTE-System deployment, offering isolated networking environment with complete control over network configuration, security, and connectivity. Proper VPC design is crucial for security, performance, and scalability of your trading system.

**Network Topology Planning**

Design a VPC architecture that supports the Smart-0DTE-System's requirements for high availability, security, and performance. The recommended architecture includes multiple Availability Zones for redundancy, separate subnets for different tiers (web, application, database), and appropriate routing for secure communication.

Plan your IP address space carefully to accommodate current requirements and future growth. Use private IP address ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16) and allocate sufficient address space for all planned resources. A /16 network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) typically provides adequate address space for most deployments.

Consider network segmentation requirements for security and compliance. Separate sensitive components such as databases and internal services from public-facing components using different subnets and security groups. This segmentation provides defense in depth and limits the impact of potential security breaches.

**Multi-Availability Zone Configuration**

Configure your VPC to span multiple Availability Zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance for your Smart-0DTE-System. Use at least two Availability Zones, with three being preferred for maximum resilience. This configuration ensures that your trading system can continue operating even if an entire Availability Zone becomes unavailable.

Design subnet allocation across Availability Zones to ensure even distribution of resources and load. Create public subnets for load balancers and NAT gateways, private subnets for application servers, and database subnets for database instances in each Availability Zone.

Plan for cross-Availability Zone communication and data transfer costs. While AWS provides high-speed, low-latency connections between Availability Zones, data transfer between zones incurs charges that should be considered in your cost planning and architecture design.

**Subnet Design and Configuration**

Create a comprehensive subnet design that separates different tiers of your Smart-0DTE-System architecture. Public subnets host resources that need direct internet access such as load balancers and NAT gateways. Private subnets host application servers and internal services that should not be directly accessible from the internet.

Database subnets provide additional isolation for database instances and should be configured with the most restrictive access controls. These subnets typically have no direct internet access and communicate only with application servers through carefully controlled security group rules.

Configure subnet routing tables to control traffic flow between subnets and to external networks. Public subnets route internet traffic through an Internet Gateway, while private subnets route internet traffic through NAT Gateways for outbound connectivity without allowing inbound internet access.

### Security Groups and Network ACLs

**Security Group Configuration**

Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances and other AWS resources, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Design security groups with specific purposes and minimal necessary permissions to maintain strong security posture for your Smart-0DTE-System.

Create separate security groups for different components including web servers, application servers, database servers, and load balancers. Each security group should allow only the specific traffic required for that component's function, following the principle of least privilege for network access.

Configure security group rules to allow communication between tiers while restricting unnecessary access. For example, database security groups should allow access only from application server security groups on specific database ports, preventing direct database access from other sources.

**Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**

Network ACLs provide subnet-level traffic filtering as an additional layer of security beyond security groups. Configure NACLs to provide broad traffic filtering at the subnet level while relying on security groups for specific instance-level controls.

Design NACL rules to block known malicious traffic patterns and provide defense against network-based attacks. NACLs can block traffic from specific IP ranges, countries, or networks that are known sources of malicious activity.

Configure NACL logging to monitor network traffic patterns and identify potential security threats or unusual activity. NACL logs can provide valuable information for security analysis and incident response for your Smart-0DTE-System.

**Network Monitoring and Analysis**

Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow logs provide detailed network traffic information that can be used for security analysis, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting network issues.

Configure flow log analysis using AWS services such as CloudWatch Insights or third-party tools to identify traffic patterns, security threats, and performance issues. Automated analysis can provide real-time alerts for suspicious network activity or performance degradation.

Set up network performance monitoring to track latency, throughput, and packet loss across your Smart-0DTE-System network infrastructure. Network performance is critical for trading systems that require low latency and high reliability for market data and order execution.

### Internet Connectivity and NAT Configuration

**Internet Gateway Setup**

Configure an Internet Gateway to provide internet connectivity for your VPC and enable communication between your Smart-0DTE-System and external services such as market data providers and broker APIs. The Internet Gateway provides bidirectional internet connectivity for resources in public subnets.

Attach the Internet Gateway to your VPC and configure routing tables to direct internet traffic through the gateway. Public subnets should have routes to the Internet Gateway for both inbound and outbound internet connectivity.

Configure security measures to protect internet-facing resources including security groups, NACLs, and application-level security controls. Internet connectivity increases attack surface and requires careful security configuration to protect your trading system.

**NAT Gateway Configuration**

Deploy NAT Gateways in public subnets to provide outbound internet connectivity for resources in private subnets without allowing inbound internet access. NAT Gateways enable application servers and other private resources to download updates, access external APIs, and communicate with internet services while maintaining security.

Configure NAT Gateways in multiple Availability Zones for high availability and fault tolerance. Each private subnet should route internet traffic through a NAT Gateway in the same Availability Zone to minimize latency and avoid cross-zone data transfer charges.

Monitor NAT Gateway performance and costs as they can become significant for high-traffic applications. Consider NAT Gateway bandwidth limits and scaling characteristics when planning for peak traffic loads in your Smart-0DTE-System.

**DNS and Domain Configuration**

Configure DNS resolution for your VPC using Amazon Route 53 or external DNS providers. Proper DNS configuration is essential for service discovery, load balancing, and external connectivity for your Smart-0DTE-System.

Set up private hosted zones for internal service discovery and communication within your VPC. Private DNS enables services to communicate using meaningful names rather than IP addresses, simplifying configuration and improving maintainability.

Configure public DNS records for external access to your Smart-0DTE-System including web interfaces, APIs, and monitoring dashboards. Use appropriate DNS record types (A, CNAME, ALIAS) and configure health checks for automatic failover and load distribution.
