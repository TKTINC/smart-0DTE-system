Earnings feature engineering includes time-to-earnings features, earnings surprise history, estimate revision trends, and post-earnings volatility patterns. The earnings features should capture the predictable patterns around earnings events that create systematic trading opportunities.

**Model Architecture Adaptations**

Machine learning model architecture for individual stocks requires adaptations to handle the increased feature complexity and longer time horizons compared to ETF models. The model architecture should provide accurate predictions while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time signal generation.

Ensemble modeling approaches combine multiple model types including technical analysis models, fundamental analysis models, and earnings prediction models to provide comprehensive trading signals. The ensemble approach should weight different model outputs based on market conditions and model performance.

```python
class IndividualStockEnsembleModel:
    def __init__(self, symbol):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.technical_model = self.load_technical_model()
        self.fundamental_model = self.load_fundamental_model()
        self.earnings_model = self.load_earnings_model()
        self.ensemble_weights = self.load_ensemble_weights()
        
    def generate_signal(self, current_data):
        """Generate ensemble trading signal"""
        technical_signal = self.technical_model.predict(current_data['technical_features'])
        fundamental_signal = self.fundamental_model.predict(current_data['fundamental_features'])
        earnings_signal = self.earnings_model.predict(current_data['earnings_features'])
        
        # Adjust weights based on market conditions
        adjusted_weights = self.adjust_weights_for_conditions(current_data)
        
        # Calculate ensemble signal
        ensemble_signal = (
            technical_signal * adjusted_weights['technical'] +
            fundamental_signal * adjusted_weights['fundamental'] +
            earnings_signal * adjusted_weights['earnings']
        )
        
        # Apply confidence scoring
        confidence = self.calculate_signal_confidence(
            technical_signal, fundamental_signal, earnings_signal
        )
        
        return {
            'signal': ensemble_signal,
            'confidence': confidence,
            'component_signals': {
                'technical': technical_signal,
                'fundamental': fundamental_signal,
                'earnings': earnings_signal
            }
        }
```

class IndividualStockRiskModel:
    def __init__(self, symbol):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.price_history = self.load_price_history()
        self.options_data = self.load_options_data()
        self.fundamental_data = self.load_fundamental_data()
        
    def calculate_var(self, position_size, confidence_level=0.95, horizon_days=1):
        """Calculate Value at Risk for individual stock position"""
        # Historical simulation approach
        returns = self.calculate_historical_returns(lookback_days=252)
        
        # Adjust for current volatility regime
        current_vol = self.calculate_current_volatility()
        historical_vol = np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252)
        vol_adjustment = current_vol / historical_vol
        
        adjusted_returns = returns * vol_adjustment
        
        # Calculate VaR
        var_percentile = (1 - confidence_level) * 100
        var = np.percentile(adjusted_returns, var_percentile) * position_size
        
        return {
            'var_1d': var,
            'var_7d': var * np.sqrt(horizon_days),
            'volatility_adjustment': vol_adjustment,
            'confidence_level': confidence_level
        }
    
    def assess_event_risk(self, position_details):
        """Assess event risk for individual stock position"""
        upcoming_events = self.get_upcoming_events()
        event_risks = []
        
        for event in upcoming_events:
            if event['type'] == 'earnings':
                earnings_risk = self.calculate_earnings_risk(position_details, event)
                event_risks.append(earnings_risk)
            elif event['type'] == 'product_launch':
                product_risk = self.calculate_product_risk(position_details, event)
                event_risks.append(product_risk)
                
        return {
            'total_event_risk': sum([r['risk_amount'] for r in event_risks]),
            'individual_risks': event_risks,
            'risk_mitigation_suggestions': self.suggest_risk_mitigation(event_risks)
        }
```

Liquidity risk assessment includes analysis of options bid-ask spreads, trading volumes, and market impact estimates for individual stock options. The liquidity assessment should provide accurate estimates of execution costs and market impact for position sizing and execution strategy development.

Credit and counterparty risk analysis includes assessment of broker risk, clearing risk, and settlement risk for individual stock options trading. The credit risk analysis should ensure appropriate risk controls while enabling efficient trading operations.

**Portfolio-Level Risk Aggregation**

Portfolio-level risk aggregation for individual stock portfolios requires sophisticated analysis of correlation effects, sector concentration, and combined exposure metrics. The risk aggregation should provide accurate portfolio risk estimates while identifying concentration risks and diversification opportunities.

Correlation risk analysis includes dynamic correlation modeling, correlation breakdown analysis, and stress testing of correlation assumptions. The correlation analysis should account for the time-varying nature of individual stock correlations and the potential for correlation increases during stress periods.

```python
class PortfolioRiskAggregator:
    def __init__(self, portfolio_positions):
        self.positions = portfolio_positions
        self.correlation_matrix = self.load_correlation_matrix()
        
    def calculate_portfolio_var(self, confidence_level=0.95):
        """Calculate portfolio Value at Risk with correlation effects"""
        individual_vars = []
        position_weights = []
        
        for position in self.positions:
            stock_var = self.calculate_individual_var(position)
            individual_vars.append(stock_var)
            position_weights.append(position['notional_value'])
            
        # Normalize weights
        total_notional = sum(position_weights)
        weights = [w / total_notional for w in position_weights]
        
        # Calculate portfolio VaR with correlation
        portfolio_variance = 0
        for i in range(len(weights)):
            for j in range(len(weights)):
                correlation = self.correlation_matrix[i][j]
                portfolio_variance += weights[i] * weights[j] * individual_vars[i] * individual_vars[j] * correlation
                
        portfolio_var = np.sqrt(portfolio_variance)
        
        # Calculate diversification benefit
        undiversified_var = sum([w * var for w, var in zip(weights, individual_vars)])
        diversification_benefit = undiversified_var - portfolio_var
        
        return {
            'portfolio_var': portfolio_var,
            'undiversified_var': undiversified_var,
            'diversification_benefit': diversification_benefit,
            'correlation_contribution': self.analyze_correlation_contribution()
        }
```

The position limits should provide appropriate risk control while enabling aggressive pursuit of trading opportunities during favorable conditions.

Volatility-adjusted position limits include dynamic scaling of position sizes based on current volatility conditions, volatility percentile rankings, and volatility forecasts. The volatility adjustment should reduce position sizes during high volatility periods while enabling larger positions during low volatility conditions.

```python
class DynamicPositionLimitManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_limits = self.load_base_position_limits()
        self.volatility_adjustments = self.load_volatility_adjustments()
        
    def calculate_position_limit(self, symbol, strategy_type):
        """Calculate dynamic position limit for individual stock"""
        base_limit = self.base_limits[symbol][strategy_type]
        
        # Volatility adjustment
        current_vol = self.get_current_volatility(symbol)
        vol_percentile = self.calculate_volatility_percentile(symbol, current_vol)
        vol_adjustment = self.volatility_adjustments[vol_percentile]
        
        # Correlation adjustment
        correlation_risk = self.assess_correlation_risk(symbol)
        corr_adjustment = self.calculate_correlation_adjustment(correlation_risk)
        
        # Event risk adjustment
        event_risk = self.assess_upcoming_events(symbol)
        event_adjustment = self.calculate_event_adjustment(event_risk)
        
        # Calculate final limit
        adjusted_limit = base_limit * vol_adjustment * corr_adjustment * event_adjustment
        
        return {
            'position_limit': adjusted_limit,
            'base_limit': base_limit,
            'adjustments': {
                'volatility': vol_adjustment,
                'correlation': corr_adjustment,
                'event_risk': event_adjustment
            }
        }
```

Event-based position limits include automatic position reduction around earnings announcements, product launches, and other high-risk events. The event limits should provide appropriate risk control while maintaining the ability to capitalize on event-driven opportunities.

Correlation-based position limits include dynamic adjustment of position sizes based on correlation conditions and sector concentration levels. The correlation limits should prevent excessive concentration while enabling diversified exposure to the Magnificent 7 stocks.
