## Prerequisites and System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

The Smart-0DTE-System requires adequate computing resources to handle real-time market data processing, multiple database services, and concurrent frontend and backend development. The minimum recommended hardware specifications ensure smooth development experience and realistic performance testing.

**Minimum System Specifications**

Your development machine should have at least 16GB of RAM to accommodate the multiple services running simultaneously. The system utilizes PostgreSQL, Redis, InfluxDB, the FastAPI backend, and the React frontend development server concurrently. With 16GB RAM, you can comfortably run all services while maintaining system responsiveness for development tasks.

Storage requirements include at least 50GB of available disk space for the development environment. This allocation covers the operating system, development tools, Docker containers, database storage, and application code. SSD storage is strongly recommended for optimal performance, particularly for database operations and Docker container management.

CPU requirements include a modern multi-core processor with at least 4 cores. The system benefits from higher core counts for parallel processing of market data and concurrent service execution. Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7 processors from recent generations provide excellent performance for development workloads.

**Recommended System Specifications**

For optimal development experience, 32GB of RAM enables comfortable operation of all services with additional headroom for development tools, multiple browser tabs, and system overhead. This configuration supports more realistic load testing and performance analysis during development.

Storage recommendations include 100GB or more of SSD storage for comprehensive development setup including multiple database environments, extensive logging, and backup storage. NVMe SSD storage provides the best performance for database operations and Docker container management.

CPU recommendations include 8 or more cores for optimal parallel processing capabilities. Modern processors with high single-thread performance benefit real-time data processing and compilation tasks. Apple M1/M2 processors provide excellent performance for development workloads with their unified memory architecture.

### Operating System Compatibility

The Smart-0DTE-System supports development on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems through Docker containerization and cross-platform development tools. Each operating system requires specific setup considerations and tool installations.

**Windows Development Environment**

Windows 10 version 2004 or Windows 11 provides the best compatibility with modern development tools and Docker Desktop. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) is highly recommended for improved Docker performance and Linux-compatible development workflows. WSL2 provides near-native Linux performance while maintaining Windows desktop compatibility.

Docker Desktop for Windows requires Hyper-V support or WSL2 backend for container execution. The WSL2 backend generally provides better performance and resource utilization compared to Hyper-V. Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS settings for proper Docker operation.

Windows Terminal or PowerShell 7 provides improved command-line experience for development tasks. Git for Windows includes necessary Unix-style tools and Git integration for repository management. Visual Studio Code with WSL extension enables seamless development across Windows and Linux environments.

**macOS Development Environment**

macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later provides full compatibility with all development tools and Docker Desktop. Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2) offer excellent performance for development workloads, though some Docker images may require ARM64 compatibility or Rosetta 2 translation.

Docker Desktop for Mac provides native container support with optimized performance for macOS. The latest versions include improved file system performance and resource management specifically optimized for development workflows.

Homebrew package manager simplifies installation of development tools and dependencies. Xcode Command Line Tools provides essential development utilities including Git, compilers, and system libraries required for various development tasks.

**Linux Development Environment**

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later provides excellent compatibility and long-term support for development environments. Other distributions including Fedora, CentOS, and Debian are also supported with appropriate package management adjustments.

Docker Engine installation on Linux provides optimal performance without virtualization overhead. Docker Compose enables easy multi-container application management for the Smart-0DTE-System's microservices architecture.

Package managers including apt, yum, or dnf provide easy installation of development dependencies. Most Linux distributions include Git and essential development tools by default, simplifying initial setup requirements.

### Network and Internet Requirements

The Smart-0DTE-System requires reliable internet connectivity for market data feeds, broker integration, and external service dependencies. Development environments need consistent connectivity for package downloads, API access, and real-time data testing.

**Bandwidth Requirements**

Minimum bandwidth of 10 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload supports basic development activities including package downloads, Git operations, and simulated market data feeds. Higher bandwidth improves development experience through faster package installations and more responsive external service interactions.

Recommended bandwidth of 50 Mbps or higher enables realistic testing of real-time market data feeds and broker integrations. This bandwidth supports multiple concurrent data streams and provides headroom for other development activities without impacting system performance.

**Latency Considerations**

Low latency internet connections improve development experience when working with real-time market data and broker APIs. While development environments can tolerate higher latency than production systems, consistent low latency enables more realistic testing of time-sensitive trading operations.

Stable connectivity is more important than absolute speed for development purposes. Intermittent connectivity issues can disrupt development workflows and cause data synchronization problems with external services.
