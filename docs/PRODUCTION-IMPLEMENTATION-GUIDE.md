## Data Feed Architecture and Pricing

### Recommended Data Feed Provider

The Smart-0DTE-System is architected to support multiple data feed providers, with **Polygon.io** as the primary recommended provider for production deployment. Polygon.io offers exceptional value proposition for focused ETF trading applications, providing comprehensive real-time and historical market data through both WebSocket and REST API interfaces.

The selection of Polygon.io as the primary data provider is based on several critical factors that align perfectly with the Smart-0DTE-System's focused architecture. First, Polygon.io provides unlimited symbol access within their pricing tiers, which means the system can access SPY, QQQ, IWM, and VIX data without per-symbol charges that would be prohibitive with traditional financial data providers. Second, their WebSocket streaming infrastructure is specifically designed for high-frequency trading applications, offering sub-millisecond latency for options data that is crucial for 0DTE trading strategies.

The pricing structure for Polygon.io follows a tiered model that scales with usage requirements. The **Starter Plan** at $99/month provides real-time data access with 5 concurrent WebSocket connections, which is sufficient for initial deployment and testing phases. The **Developer Plan** at $399/month increases concurrent connections to 50 and adds historical data access, making it suitable for backtesting and strategy development. For production deployment, the **Advanced Plan** at $999/month provides unlimited concurrent connections, priority data access, and enhanced SLA guarantees that ensure consistent performance during high-volatility periods when 0DTE strategies are most active.

### WebSocket vs API Connection Architecture

The Smart-0DTE-System implements a hybrid approach that leverages both WebSocket streaming for real-time data and REST API calls for historical data retrieval and system initialization. This dual-mode architecture provides optimal performance characteristics while maintaining system reliability and cost efficiency.

The WebSocket implementation establishes persistent connections to Polygon.io's streaming endpoints, specifically subscribing to the following data streams for each of the four target symbols. The system subscribes to Level 1 quotes (bid/ask updates), trade executions, and aggregate minute bars for SPY, QQQ, and IWM. For VIX, the system subscribes to index value updates and volatility surface changes. The WebSocket connection maintains automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff to handle network interruptions gracefully.

The REST API integration handles historical data retrieval for backtesting, strategy calibration, and system initialization. When the system starts, it retrieves the previous 30 days of minute-bar data for all four symbols to establish baseline statistics and correlation matrices. The API also handles options chain retrieval, fetching current strike prices, implied volatilities, and Greeks for at-the-money options across all expiration dates.

### Customized Data Retrieval for Four Tickers

The Smart-0DTE-System's data retrieval architecture is specifically optimized for the four target symbols: SPY, QQQ, IWM, and VIX. This focused approach enables significant performance optimizations and cost reductions compared to broader market data systems.

The system implements symbol-specific data handlers that are tuned for each instrument's unique characteristics. The SPY handler processes the highest volume of options data, implementing aggressive caching strategies and real-time Greeks calculations. The QQQ handler focuses on technology sector correlation analysis and after-hours trading patterns. The IWM handler emphasizes small-cap volatility patterns and sector rotation signals. The VIX handler processes volatility surface data and term structure analysis.

Data filtering occurs at multiple levels to ensure optimal resource utilization. At the WebSocket subscription level, the system only subscribes to data streams for the four target symbols, eliminating unnecessary network traffic and processing overhead. At the application level, incoming data is immediately filtered and routed to symbol-specific processing pipelines. At the storage level, the database schema is optimized for time-series data from these four instruments, with custom indexing strategies that accelerate common query patterns.

The system implements intelligent data prioritization during high-volume periods. During market open and close, when data volume peaks, the system prioritizes SPY data processing due to its role as the primary market indicator, followed by QQQ, IWM, and VIX in order of trading volume and signal importance. This prioritization ensures that critical trading signals are processed with minimal latency even during extreme market conditions.

### Data Retrieval Intervals and Market Coverage

The Smart-0DTE-System implements a sophisticated data retrieval schedule that balances real-time responsiveness with resource efficiency. The system operates on multiple time horizons simultaneously to support both high-frequency 0DTE strategies and longer-term pattern recognition.

For real-time trading operations, the system processes tick-by-tick data during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM ET) with sub-second latency requirements. WebSocket streams provide immediate updates for price changes, volume spikes, and volatility shifts. The system maintains separate processing threads for each symbol to ensure that high-volume periods in one instrument do not impact data processing for others.

Minute-bar aggregation occurs continuously during market hours, with completed bars stored in the time-series database and immediately processed by the correlation engine and signal generation algorithms. Five-minute bars are used for intermediate-term pattern recognition, while hourly bars support longer-term trend analysis and regime change detection.

The system retrieves and processes data on all market trading days, not just 0DTE expiration days. This comprehensive data collection is essential for several reasons. First, the correlation analysis and volatility modeling require continuous data streams to maintain accurate statistical relationships between the four instruments. Second, the AI signal generation algorithms use multi-day patterns to identify setup conditions that may culminate in 0DTE trading opportunities. Third, the tax optimization features require complete trading history to accurately calculate wash sale implications and optimize holding periods.

Pre-market and after-hours data collection focuses on futures markets and international indices that may impact the four target ETFs. The system monitors ES (S&P 500 futures), NQ (Nasdaq futures), and RTY (Russell 2000 futures) during extended hours to identify overnight developments that may create trading opportunities at market open.

### Data Storage and Retention Policies

The Smart-0DTE-System implements a tiered data storage strategy that balances immediate access requirements with long-term storage costs. Real-time data is stored in Redis for sub-millisecond access, with automatic expiration policies that remove data older than 24 hours. Minute-bar data is stored in InfluxDB, a time-series database optimized for financial data, with retention policies that maintain full granularity for 90 days and downsampled data for historical analysis.

The system maintains separate storage tiers for different data types and access patterns. High-frequency tick data is compressed and archived to AWS S3 Glacier after 7 days, with retrieval capabilities for backtesting and regulatory compliance. Options data, including implied volatilities and Greeks, is maintained in PostgreSQL with specialized indexing for rapid strike and expiration lookups. Correlation matrices and statistical models are cached in Redis with hourly refresh cycles.

Data backup and disaster recovery procedures ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance. The system implements real-time replication to a secondary AWS region, with automated failover capabilities that can restore full functionality within 15 minutes of a primary system failure. Daily backups are encrypted and stored across multiple geographic regions to meet regulatory requirements for financial data retention.



## Broker Integration and Execution Framework

### Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as Default Integration

The Smart-0DTE-System is architected with Interactive Brokers (IBKR) as the default broker integration, leveraging IBKR's robust API infrastructure and competitive options pricing structure. IBKR provides several advantages that make it ideal for 0DTE options trading, including direct market access, competitive commission structures, and comprehensive risk management tools.

The IBKR integration utilizes the Interactive Brokers Gateway (IBGateway) rather than Trader Workstation (TWS) for production deployments. IBGateway provides a headless, API-focused interface that is optimized for algorithmic trading applications. The gateway supports multiple concurrent connections, enabling the Smart-0DTE-System to maintain separate connections for market data, order management, and account monitoring.

The system implements IBKR's native API through the ib_insync Python library, which provides asynchronous communication capabilities essential for high-frequency options trading. The integration supports all order types relevant to 0DTE strategies, including market orders, limit orders, stop orders, and complex multi-leg options strategies such as iron condors, butterflies, and calendar spreads.

Risk management integration with IBKR's native systems provides multiple layers of protection. The system respects IBKR's account-level risk controls, including buying power limitations, position concentration limits, and pattern day trader regulations. Additionally, the Smart-0DTE-System implements its own risk overlay that can impose stricter limits based on volatility conditions, correlation breakdowns, or AI confidence levels.

### Multi-Broker Architecture and Future Extensibility

While IBKR serves as the default broker, the Smart-0DTE-System is designed with a pluggable broker architecture that enables seamless integration with additional brokers. The system implements a standardized broker interface that abstracts common trading operations, making it straightforward to add support for other brokers without modifying core trading logic.

The broker abstraction layer defines standard methods for account management, order placement, position monitoring, and market data access. Each broker implementation provides concrete implementations of these methods while handling broker-specific authentication, message formatting, and error handling. This architecture enables the system to support multiple brokers simultaneously, allowing users to route different strategies to different brokers based on execution quality, commission structures, or regulatory requirements.

Future broker integrations are planned for several major platforms. TD Ameritrade (now Charles Schwab) integration would provide access to thinkorswim's advanced options analytics and paper trading capabilities. E*TRADE integration would offer competitive pricing for retail traders and simplified account setup procedures. Tastyworks integration would provide specialized options trading tools and educational resources that complement the Smart-0DTE-System's AI-driven approach.

The multi-broker architecture also supports broker-specific optimizations. For example, IBKR integration emphasizes direct market access and institutional-grade execution quality, while a future Robinhood integration might focus on simplified user experience and mobile-first design. Each broker integration can implement custom logic for order routing, execution algorithms, and risk management while maintaining compatibility with the core Smart-0DTE-System framework.

### Cloud-Based IBKR Gateway Deployment

The Smart-0DTE-System implements cloud-based IBKR Gateway instances to ensure reliable connectivity and optimal execution performance. Rather than requiring users to maintain local gateway connections, the system deploys dedicated gateway instances in AWS regions that provide optimal latency to IBKR's data centers.

The cloud gateway architecture utilizes Docker containers running IBGateway instances with automated authentication and connection management. Each gateway instance is configured with specific account credentials and maintains persistent connections to IBKR's servers. The system implements gateway pooling to distribute load across multiple instances and provide redundancy in case of individual gateway failures.

Gateway instances are deployed in multiple AWS availability zones to ensure high availability and minimize latency. The primary gateway cluster is deployed in the US-East-1 region, which provides optimal connectivity to IBKR's primary data centers in Connecticut. Secondary gateway instances in US-West-2 provide backup connectivity and support users in different geographic regions.

The system implements sophisticated gateway health monitoring and automatic failover procedures. Each gateway instance reports health metrics including connection status, API response times, and error rates. If a gateway instance becomes unresponsive or experiences degraded performance, the system automatically routes traffic to healthy instances while attempting to restore the failed gateway.

Authentication and security for cloud gateway instances utilize IBKR's two-factor authentication (2FA) system combined with AWS security best practices. Gateway instances store encrypted credentials in AWS Secrets Manager and implement IP whitelisting to restrict access to authorized Smart-0DTE-System components. All communication between the system and gateway instances is encrypted using TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Order Management and Execution Framework

The Smart-0DTE-System implements a sophisticated order management system (OMS) that handles the complete lifecycle of options trades from signal generation through execution and settlement. The OMS is designed specifically for 0DTE options trading, with optimizations for speed, accuracy, and risk management.

Order generation begins with AI signal processing that identifies trading opportunities based on market conditions, volatility patterns, and correlation analysis. The signal generation system produces structured trade recommendations that include entry conditions, position sizing, risk parameters, and exit criteria. These recommendations are passed to the order management system for validation and execution.

The order validation process implements multiple layers of risk checks before any order is submitted to the broker. Pre-trade risk checks verify that proposed trades comply with account limitations, position concentration limits, and regulatory requirements. The system also validates that options contracts are liquid enough to support the intended position size and that bid-ask spreads are within acceptable ranges for profitable execution.

Order routing logic optimizes execution quality by analyzing real-time market conditions and selecting appropriate order types and timing. For liquid options like SPY and QQQ at-the-money strikes, the system typically uses limit orders with aggressive pricing to ensure rapid execution. For less liquid options or larger position sizes, the system may implement time-weighted average price (TWAP) algorithms that spread orders across multiple time intervals to minimize market impact.

The system implements sophisticated position management capabilities that monitor open positions continuously and adjust risk parameters based on changing market conditions. Stop-loss orders are dynamically adjusted based on volatility conditions and time decay, while profit-taking levels are optimized using machine learning algorithms that analyze historical exit timing patterns.

### Paper Trading and Live Trading Integration

The Smart-0DTE-System provides seamless switching between paper trading and live trading modes, with comprehensive data handling that ensures consistent behavior across both environments. This capability is essential for strategy development, backtesting, and user education.

Paper trading mode utilizes a sophisticated simulation engine that replicates real market conditions while maintaining complete safety for user accounts. The simulation engine processes the same real-time market data feeds used in live trading, ensuring that paper trading results accurately reflect actual market conditions. Order fills are simulated using realistic bid-ask spread models and market impact calculations based on historical execution data.

The paper trading engine maintains separate account balances, positions, and transaction histories that mirror the structure of live trading accounts. Users can configure paper trading accounts with realistic starting balances and margin requirements that match their intended live trading parameters. This approach enables accurate assessment of strategy performance and risk characteristics before committing real capital.

Switching between paper and live trading modes is implemented through a simple configuration change that requires no code modifications or system restarts. The system maintains separate database schemas for paper and live trading data, ensuring complete isolation between simulation and real trading activities. Users can run paper and live trading simultaneously, enabling real-time comparison of strategy performance across both modes.

Data handling for reporting and analysis is designed to accommodate both paper and live trading seamlessly. The advanced reporting system can generate combined reports that show paper trading results alongside live trading performance, enabling users to validate strategy effectiveness before scaling up position sizes. Tax reporting features automatically exclude paper trading transactions while maintaining detailed records for strategy analysis and regulatory compliance.

The system implements comprehensive audit trails for both paper and live trading that track all system decisions, order modifications, and execution results. These audit trails are essential for strategy refinement, regulatory compliance, and performance attribution analysis. Paper trading audit trails help identify potential issues before they impact live trading, while live trading audit trails provide complete documentation for tax reporting and regulatory requirements.
