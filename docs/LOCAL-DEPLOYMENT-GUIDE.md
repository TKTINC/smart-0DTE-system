Initialize the database environment by executing the Docker Compose command to start all database services. This process will download the necessary Docker images, create database containers, and establish the required networking connections between services.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis influxdb
```

Verify that all database services are running correctly by checking the container status and examining the service logs for any error messages. Each database service should report successful startup and readiness to accept connections.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs postgres
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs redis
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs influxdb
```

Execute the database initialization scripts to create the required schemas, tables, and initial data. The initialization scripts are located in the database/migrations directory and should be executed in the correct order to ensure proper schema creation.

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create_initial_data
```

### Backend Services Configuration
