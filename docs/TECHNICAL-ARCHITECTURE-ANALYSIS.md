## Data Feed Architecture

### Recommended Data Feed Provider

Based on the current implementation analysis, the Smart-0DTE-System is designed with a flexible data feed architecture that can accommodate multiple providers. The recommended approach prioritizes cost-effectiveness while maintaining real-time capabilities for the focused ETF/VIX trading strategy.

**Primary Recommendation: Polygon.io**

Polygon.io emerges as the optimal choice for the Smart-0DTE-System's focused approach to SPY, QQQ, IWM, and VIX trading. The service offers WebSocket-based real-time streaming with competitive pricing specifically advantageous for limited symbol sets. For the four target instruments, Polygon.io provides comprehensive market data including real-time quotes, trades, and options chains through their WebSocket API.

The pricing structure aligns perfectly with the system's focused approach. Polygon.io's "Starter" plan at $99/month provides real-time data for up to 5 symbols, making it ideal for the SPY, QQQ, IWM, and VIX focus. This represents exceptional value compared to enterprise-level providers that charge thousands monthly for broader market coverage that the Smart-0DTE-System doesn't require.

**Alternative Providers for Consideration**

Alpha Vantage offers a cost-effective alternative with their real-time data API, though with higher latency than Polygon.io. Their premium plan at $49.99/month provides real-time data suitable for less latency-sensitive components of the system. IEX Cloud presents another viable option with transparent pricing and reliable WebSocket feeds, particularly attractive for its ethical market data approach and competitive rates for limited symbol sets.

For users requiring the highest data quality and lowest latency, Bloomberg Terminal API integration remains possible, though at significantly higher cost ($2,000+/month). This option would be justified only for institutional deployments where microsecond latency advantages translate to meaningful profit improvements.

### WebSocket vs API Connection Architecture

The current implementation utilizes a hybrid approach that maximizes efficiency while maintaining reliability. The system employs WebSocket connections for real-time streaming data and REST API calls for historical data and system initialization.

**WebSocket Implementation Details**

The DataFeedService class implements persistent WebSocket connections for each data type. Real-time market data streams through dedicated WebSocket channels with automatic reconnection logic and connection health monitoring. The implementation maintains separate WebSocket connections for market data, options chains, and VIX data to ensure isolation and prevent single points of failure.

Connection management includes exponential backoff retry logic, heartbeat monitoring, and graceful degradation when connections fail. The system automatically switches to polling mode if WebSocket connections become unstable, ensuring continuous operation even during network disruptions.

**API Integration for Historical Data**

REST API calls handle historical data retrieval, system initialization, and periodic data validation. The system uses API calls to backfill data during startup, validate WebSocket data integrity, and retrieve extended historical datasets for backtesting and analysis.

Rate limiting and request optimization ensure efficient API usage while staying within provider limits. The implementation includes intelligent caching to minimize redundant API calls and reduce costs.

### Data Retrieval Customization

The Smart-0DTE-System implements highly optimized data retrieval specifically designed for the four target instruments. The system's focused approach enables significant cost savings and performance improvements compared to broad market data solutions.

**Symbol-Specific Optimization**

The DataFeedService class explicitly defines the target symbols (SPY, QQQ, IWM, VIX) and configures all data streams accordingly. WebSocket subscriptions are limited to these four symbols, eliminating unnecessary data transmission and processing overhead. This targeted approach reduces bandwidth usage by approximately 99% compared to full market data feeds.

Options chain retrieval focuses exclusively on near-term expirations for the three ETFs, with particular emphasis on 0DTE options. The system requests only ATM and near-ATM strikes within a configurable range, typically Â±5% from current price, further reducing data volume and processing requirements.

**VIX-Specific Data Handling**

VIX data retrieval includes the full term structure (VIX9D, VIX, VIX3M, VIX6M) essential for volatility regime analysis. The system implements specialized VIX data processing to calculate volatility percentiles, regime changes, and correlation metrics with the target ETFs.

### Data Retrieval Intervals

The system implements intelligent interval management optimized for 0DTE options trading while maintaining cost efficiency during non-trading periods.

**Market Hours Operation**

During regular trading hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET), the system operates at maximum frequency:
- Market data updates: 1-second intervals for real-time price action
- Options data updates: 5-second intervals for Greeks and implied volatility
- VIX analysis: 30-second intervals for volatility regime monitoring
- Correlation analysis: 1-minute intervals for relationship tracking

**Extended Hours and Off-Market Operation**

During pre-market (4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET) and after-hours (4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET), the system reduces update frequency to 30-second intervals for market data and 5-minute intervals for options data. This approach maintains awareness of overnight developments while minimizing costs.

On non-trading days (weekends and holidays), the system operates in maintenance mode with hourly data validation checks and system health monitoring. Historical data processing and backtesting operations continue during these periods to maximize system utilization.

**0DTE-Specific Scheduling**

The system includes specialized scheduling for 0DTE expiration days. On expiration Fridays, the system increases monitoring frequency in the final hour of trading, with market data updates every 500 milliseconds and options data updates every 2 seconds to capture rapid time decay and volatility changes.
